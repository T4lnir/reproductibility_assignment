## R Markdown

```{r}
# #run only once to download the data
# stroop_data <-read.table("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Lakens/Stroop/master/stroop.txt", sep = "\t", header = TRUE)
# 
# write.table(stroop_data, file = "stroop.csv", quote=F, row.names=F)

stroop_data <- read.csv("stroop.csv", sep = " ", header = TRUE)

```


```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
